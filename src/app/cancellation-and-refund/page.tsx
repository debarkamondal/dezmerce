      <p>
        This is a website to add to my portfolio. This page is only a
        placeholder for Razorpay. We are not selling anything please so there is
        no question of cancellation and returns Debarka Mondal believes in
        helping its customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
        cancellation policy. Under this policy: Cancellations will be considered
        only if the request is made within 2-3 days of placing the order.
        However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders
        have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated
        the process of shipping them. Debarka Mondal does not accept
        cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc.
        However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that
        the quality of product delivered is not good. In case of receipt of
        damaged or defective items please report the same to our Customer
        Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the
        merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This should
        be reported within 2-3 days of receipt of the products. In case you feel
        that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your
        expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service
        within 2-3 days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team
        after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision. In
        case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
        manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any Refunds
        approved by the Debarka Mondal, itâ€™ll take 2-3 days for the refund to be
        processed to the end customer.
